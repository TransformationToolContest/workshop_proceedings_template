\preface{
The aim of the Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) series is to compare the expressiveness, the usability, and the performance of transformation tools along a number of selected case studies.
A deeper understanding of the relative merits of different tool features will help to further improve transformation tools and to indicate open problems.

This contest was the ninth of its kind.
For the fourth time, the contest was part of the Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF) federation of conferences.
Teams from the major international players in transformation tool development have participated in an online setting as well as in a face-to-face workshop.

In order to facilitate the comparison of transformation tools, our programme committee
selected the following challenging case via single blind reviews: Class Responsibility Assignment Case, for which eventually eight solutions were accepted.

These proceedings comprise descriptions of the case study and all of the accepted solutions.
In addition to the solution descriptions contained in these proceedings, the implementation of each solution (tool, project files, documentation) is made available for review and demonstration via the SHARE platform (http://share20.eu).

TTC 2016 involved open (i.e., non anonymous) peer reviews in a first round.
The purpose of this round of reviewing was that the participants gained as much insight into
the competitors’ solutions as possible and also to identify potential problems.
At the workshop, the solutions were presented.
The expert audience judged the solutions along a number of case-specific categories, and prizes were awarded to the highest scoring solutions in each category.
A summary of these results for each case are included in these proceedings.
Finally, the solutions appearing in these proceedings were selected by our programme committee via single blind reviews. The full results of the contest are published on our website\footnote{\url{http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/}}.

Besides the presentations of the submitted solutions, the workshop also comprised a live contest.
That contest involved creating a solution for dataflow-based model transformations.
The live contest was announced to all STAF attendees and participants were given four days to design, implement and test their solutions.
The contest organisers thank all authors for submitting cases and solutions, the contest
participants, the STAF local organisation team, the STAF general chair Gerti Kappel, and the program committee for their support.
