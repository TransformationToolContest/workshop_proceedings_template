\preface{The aim of the Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) series is to compare
the expressiveness, the usability, and the performance of transformation tools
along a number of selected case studies. A deeper understanding of the relative
merits of different tool features will help to further improve transformation
tools and to indicate open problems.

This contest was the twelfth of its kind. For the seventh time, the contest was
part of the Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF)
federation of conferences. Teams from the major international players in
transformation tool development have participated in an online setting as well
as in a face-to-face workshop.

The previous editions have focused on cases exploring specific research
directions in model-transformation (such as bi-directional transformation,
traceability, verifiability or performance). This year the committee selected a
case study that presents a well-known simple transformation, namely the
\emph{Truth Tables to Binary Decision Diagrams}. The aim of this case is to
serve as a showcase of the various directions that model transformation
research is going towards at the moment. Similarly to previous years, there was
also a live case study.

These proceedings comprise descriptions of the case study and all of the
accepted solutions. In addition to the solution descriptions contained in these
proceedings, the implementation of each solution (tool, project files,
documentation) is made available in public version control repositories.

TTC 2019 involved open (i.e., non anonymous) peer reviews in a first round. The
purpose of this round of reviewing was that the participants gained as much
insight into the competitors’ solutions as possible and also to identify
potential problems. At the workshop, the solutions were presented. The expert
audience judged the solutions along a number of case-specific categories, and
prizes were awarded to the highest scoring solutions in each category. Finally,
the solutions appearing in these proceedings were selected by our programme
committee via single blind reviews. The full results of the contest are
published on our
website\footnote{\url{http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/}}.

Besides the presentations of the submitted solutions, the workshop also
comprised a live contest that was announced to all STAF attendees and
participants were given four days to design, implement and test their solutions.
Some of the live case solutions were also submitted for a peer review and the
accepted ones are included in the second part of this proceedings.

The contest organisers thank all authors for submitting cases and solutions, the
contest participants, the STAF local organisation team, the STAF general chair
Mark van den Brand, and the program committee for their support. }
